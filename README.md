# Data Science & Analytics Portfolio
This repository contains projects and visualizations created from the Data Science & Analytics program with UNLV and self learning projects. These projects are presented in Jupyter Notebooks

## Data Storytelling | [Evaluation of Stars on Their Similarity to the Sun](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/annika.dinulos/viz/StarsReport/Dashboard1)
This report was originally completed on Excel, then redone as a dashboard in Tableau. The goal of this project was to determine if any stars within the given dataset would be similar enough to the Sun to research for their potential to power life. This dashboard makes comparisons between absolute magnitude, radius, and temperature. 

## [Visual Communications](data-analysis-projects/Milestone-2/MilestoneProject2.ipynb)
The purpose of Milestone Project 2 is to clean bird watching data in SQL and Python to generate visualizations and insightful dashboards in [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/annika.dinulos/viz/Milestone2Dashboards/LonerTravel). The goal was to provide information for three different types of bird-watchers who would like to go on vacation. Each profile and dashboard contains a specific area of the world highlighted on a map that would best suit their interests, as well as helpful tips about the area, tourist spots and resorts. 

## Business Intelligence | [What Does It Take to be a NASA Astronaut?](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/annika.dinulos/viz/AstronautsFinal/Dashboard1)
The business intelligence project goal was to create a dashboard that displays information about the people chosen to be NASA astronauts between 1959-2013. I wanted to create a dashboard that highlighted some specific characteristics of these astronauts and follow their path to NASA, from undergraduate degrees, graduate degrees, military enlistment, as well as the differences between men and women. It was important to me to focus on both women and men in this project, so women can trace a path in a male dominated industry. 
## Personal Projects
### NBA Stats 
This projects is done in three parts, the goal is to go through the full Data Analytics methodology from web scraping, data cleaning, transforming and machine learning for predictive analysis. This is a guided project through DataCamp intended to supplement my learning and machine learning understanding.

###### [Part 1 - Web Scraping from NBA reference website](data-analysis-projects/NBA-Stats/NBAStats.ipynb)
###### [Part 2 - Data Cleaning](data-analysis-projects/NBA-Stats/NBACleaning.ipynb)
###### [Part 3 - Machine Learning](data-analysis-projects/NBA-Stats/NBA_ML.ipynb)
